# TrevOS
The Real OS, The Best OS.  Well mainly just a fun educational adventure in CS!

Are you tired of using an operating system that people know by name?  Use this instead!
TrevOS doesn't pretend that it's better than other any other OS.  It proves that it's faster by running faster than Karl Matthews!  And he just got a new walker!

## Building TrevOS

You'll need a compiler that can create i686 elfs!  But once you have that, modify line 16 of the Makefile to point the directory with the compiler, then just type `make` and it should work!  Or at least tell you why it won't work.  You can test the kernel with `make emu` if you have qemu installed!
